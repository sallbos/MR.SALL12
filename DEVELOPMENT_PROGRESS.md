## 2. Detailed Technical Implementations

### A. Backend-Enforced Daily Usage & Quota System (`worker/index.js`)
- **Configurable Limits**: Configured through Worker environment variables:
  - `FREE_DAILY_LIMIT = "50"` (default 50 messages/day)
  - `PREMIUM_DAILY_LIMIT = "500"` (default 500 messages/day)
- **Persistent Storage**:
  - Bound to Cloudflare KV namespace `USAGE_KV` using key format `usage:{userId}:{YYYY-MM-DD}` with 48-hour expiration TTL.
  - Automatically falls back to an in-memory Map store (`memoryDailyUsageStore`) with UTC date pruning if KV is not yet bound, ensuring zero crashes across local development and initial deployments.
- **Quota Tracking & Enforcement**:
  - Before running any generative AI tool, the worker checks the user's current daily count against their tier limit.
  - Returns HTTP `429` with JSON `{ error: true, code: 'DAILY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED', ... }` when the quota is exhausted.
  - All API responses return standard rate-limiting headers:
    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: configured tier limit
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: remaining messages today
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: seconds remaining until 00:00 UTC midnight
    - `X-User-Tier`: `free` or `premium`
  - Exposes `/api/usage` endpoint so the frontend dashboard and settings modal can inspect live counts without consuming a message credit.

### B. Frontend Usage Tracker (`js/tools.js` & `js/app.js`)
- **`UsageTracker` Module**:
  - Reads and writes `localStorage('mrsall_usage_stats')`.
  - Automatically resets if the date has rolled over past UTC midnight.
  - Intercepts `fetch` headers in `API.call` and updates all UI counters across the active page.
  - Injects a branded Daily Limit Reached Modal with quota information and an upgrade button when a 429 response is encountered.
  - Exposes `updateAllUI()` to update `.usage-remaining`, `.usage-limit`, `.usage-used`, and `.usage-progress-bar`.
- **Navbar Quota Pill**:
  - Compact badge in the navbar: `⚡ 50/50 left`.
  - Live tooltip with messages remaining today.

### C. Interactive User Dashboard (`index.html`)
- Displays an overview for authenticated users:
  - **Welcome Message**: Personalized greeting with user's name and Google profile picture or initials.
  - **Account Status**: Free Plan or Premium Plan badge.
  - **3 Stat Cards**: Remaining Today, Used Today, and Daily Limit.
  - **Progress Bar**: Gradient-filled animated track showing percentage of daily messages used.
  - **Plan Switch / Upgrade**: One-click toggle between Free and Premium tiers with instant UI reflection.
  - **Reset Notice**: Displays daily reset time (00:00 UTC).

### D. Progressive Web App (PWA) Engine
- **Web App Manifest (`manifest.webmanifest` & `manifest.json`)**:
  - Full standalone display mode with `#080B18` theme and background colors.
  - Complete icon hierarchy: 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512, maskable 512x512, and Apple Touch Icon 180x180.
  - Desktop (1280x720) and Mobile (720x1280) screenshots.
  - Quick launch shortcuts for all 7 AI tools.
- **Service Worker (`service-worker.js`)**:
  - Precaches the entire application shell (58 files including HTML, CSS, JS, SVG and PNG assets).
  - Network-first navigation strategy with automatic fallback to `offline.html`.
  - Stale-while-revalidate strategy for static styling, scripts, and imagery.
  - Explicit exclusion for AI API calls and OAuth credential requests.
- **PWA Manager (`js/pwa.js`)**:
  - Native browser install prompt capture (`beforeinstallprompt`).
  - Custom iOS "Add to Home Screen" step-by-step guidance modal.
  - Custom Desktop installation guide modal.
  - Online and offline status detection with toast alerts.
  - Service worker background update detection with prompt to refresh.
- **Branded Offline Fallback (`offline.html`)**:
  - Responsive offline screen with mascot artwork, connection retry button, and auto-reload on reconnection.

### E. 7 Functional AI Tool Pages (`tools/*.html`)
1. **AI Chat (`tools/chat.html`)**: Multi-turn conversation UI, localStorage conversation history, Markdown formatting.
2. **AI Writer (`tools/writer.html`)**: Article, email, rewrite, and summary generators with tone selection.
3. **AI Translator (`tools/translator.html`)**: Real-time Arabic, English, and French translator with swap languages feature.
4. **AI Study (`tools/study.html`)**: Educational concepts, step-by-step explanations, practice questions, and study plans.
5. **AI Image (`tools/image.html`)**: Stability AI SDXL generator with 8 visual styles and base64 preview.
6. **AI Code (`tools/code.html`)**: Code generation, code explanation, and bug debugging across languages.
7. **PDF Assistant (`tools/pdf.html`)**: Client-side PDF.js text extraction with question-answering and document summarization.
